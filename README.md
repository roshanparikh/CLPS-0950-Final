# CLPS-0950-Final
 
An explanation for each of the 4 tasks used for our "Brain Games" cognitive task project is described below. We collected data on all 4 tasks and performed regression analysis, both of which can be found at

No toolboxes need to be downloaded in order to run these tasks - a main menu that allows the participant to click to select their choice of game is included. Once each task is completed, the code returns the user to the main menu to select another task - using the esc key exits the program altogether.

# Implicit Word Priming Task
This task contains a pre-survey and a survey period, and tests for a participant's ability to react to the presentation of a primed word, vs. a new word, vs. a non-word. A list of primed words was generated beforehand, and presented to the participant during the pre-survey period. During this pre-survey period, a primed word is presented on screen, after which the participant answers whether or not the word represents something "edible" or not via pressing down the K (edible) or L (inedble) keys. The purpose of this pre-survey period is to implicitly prime this set of words to the participant, with the hypothesis that they will have faster reaction times to these primed words during the survey period. 

During the survey period, the list of primed words is intermixed with a list of new words, which were not previously presented to the participant, and a list of non-words, derived from the scrambling of words. At random, a word of any of these 3 lists is presented to the participant, and they must respond via keypress whether the object they saw is a word (K key) or non-word (L key). We hypothesize that participants will respond fastest to the primed words, followed by the new words and finally, most slowly to the scrambled words.
