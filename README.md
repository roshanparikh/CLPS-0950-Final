# CLPS-0950-Final
 
An explanation for each of the 4 tasks used for our "Brain Games" cognitive task project is described below. We collected data on all 4 tasks and performed regression analysis, both of which can be found at

A Psychtoolbox download is needed in order to run these tasks; the Psychtoolbox window size has been decreased in order to compatible with Macs, but can be increased to fit the entire screen on other devices. The game includes a main menu that allows the participant to click to select their choice of game is included. Once each task is completed, the code returns the user to the main menu to select another task - using the esc key exits the program altogether.

# Implicit Word Priming Task
This task contains a pretest and a test period, and tests for a participant's ability to react to the presentation of a primed word, vs. a new word, vs. a non-word. A list of primed words was generated beforehand, and presented to the participant during the pretest period. During this period, a word is presented on screen, after which the participant answers whether or not the word represents something "edible" or not via pressing down the K (edible) or L (inedble) keys. The purpose of this pretest period is to implicitly prime this set of words to the participant, with the hypothesis that they will have faster reaction times to these primed words during the survey period. 

During the test period, the list of primed words is intermixed with a list of new words, which were not previously presented to the participant, and a list of non-words, derived from the scrambling of words. At random, a word of any of these 3 lists is presented to the participant, and they must respond via keypress whether the object they saw is a word (K key) or non-word (L key). We hypothesize that participants will respond fastest to the primed words, followed by the new words and finally, most slowly to the scrambled words. 

# Visual Working Memory Task
This task is a 2-back task that tests the ability of the participant to recall and respond to the color or text (depending on the level) of the word displayed 2 presentations prior. The participant uses the g, r, y and b keys to respond, as the colors used are green, red, yellow and blue. For level 1, participants respond to the color of the word; for level 2, the text; and for level 3, the color once again. Data on accuracy and reaction time was collected and is displayed at the link above. 

# RGB Anomaloscope Task
The RGB Anomaloscope Task shows two differently-colored panels and allows users to change the color of one block using a slider until the two blocks match in color. The slider is activated when a participant holds the mouse down and drags it across the grey box presented on each trial. If the participant is satisfied that they have matched the colors, they press the right arrow key to advance. There are some trials in which a match is not possible (no overlap in RGB values), and in this case the participant should press the "n" key to continue. A key catch is that many red-green colorblind individuals will see a match between the two boxes when no match is possible. Data on accuracy was collected and is displayed at the link above. 

# Stroop Test
The Stroop Test is a neurocognitive test used to assess someoneâ€™s ability to distinguish between the processing of two separate stimuli, where the processing of one stimulus interferes with the processing of the other (for example, stating the name of a word vs. the color of the word.) In this case, the participant is always asked to report on the color of the word on the screen via keypress (the exact key depends on the level, and keypress instructions are provided before each level). There are 4 levels, and as the level increases, the colors used in the test become more indistinguishable, and therefore likely more difficult to differentiate. Data on accuracy and reaction time was collected and is displayed at the link above.
