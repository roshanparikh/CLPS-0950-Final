# Implicit Word Priming Task
This task contains a pre-survey and a survey period, and tests for a participant's ability to react to the presentation of a primed word, vs. a new word, vs. a non-word. A list of primed words was generated beforehand, and presented to the participant during the pre-survey period. During this pre-survey period, a primed word is presented on screen, after which the participant answers whether #or not the word represents something "edible" or not. The purpose of this pre-survey period is to implicitly prime this set of words to the participant, with the hypothesis that they will have faster reaction times to these primed words during the survey period. 

During the survey period, the list of primed words is intermixed with a list of new words, which were not previously presented to the participant, and a list of non-words, derived from the scrambling of words. At random, a word of any of these 3 list is presented to the participant, and they must respond (via key press) whether the object they saw is a word or non-word. We hypothesize that participants will respond fastest to the primed words, followed by the new words and finally, most slowly to the non-words. 

To create more difficult levels, the degree of scrambling of the non-words can be changed: for example, changing only 2 letters in the middle of the word
